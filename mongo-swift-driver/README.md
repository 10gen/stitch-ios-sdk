Core Server (i.e. SERVER) project are **public**.

## Installation

### FIRST: Install the MongoDB C Driver
Because the driver wraps the MongoDB C driver, using it requires having the C driver's two components, `libbson` and `libmongoc`, installed on your system. 

On a Mac, you can install both components at once using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): 
`brew install mongo-c-driver`

Or on Linux, use `apt-get` to install each:
```
sudo apt-get install libbson-dev
sudo apt-get install libmongoc-dev
```

Next, see instructions for installation with either Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods in the following sections.

### NEXT: Install the Driver Using Swift Package Manager
*Please make sure you have followed the instructions in the previous section on installing the MongoDB C Driver before proceeding.*

The Swift Package Manager is integrated with the Swift build system in Swift 3.0+. See the [documentation](https://swift.org/package-manager/) for more information. 

Add MongoSwift to your dependencies in `Package.swift`:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:4.0
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyPackage",
    dependencies: [
        .package(url: "https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-swift-driver.git", .branch("master")),
    ],
    targets: [
        Target(
            name: "MyPackage",
            dependencies: ["MongoSwift"])
    ]
)
```

Then run `swift build` to download, compile, and link all your dependencies. 

### OR: Install the Driver Using CocoaPods 
*Please make sure you have followed the instructions in the previous section on installing the MongoDB C Driver before proceeding.*

CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C. You can install it by running `gem install cocoapods`. See [the CocoaPods documentation](https://cocoapods.org/) for more information.

If you don't already have a `Podfile` for your project, run `pod init` in the main directory to automatically create one with smart defaults. Add `MongoSwift` as follows:

```ruby
platform :ios, '11.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'MongoSwift', '~> 0'
end
```

Finally, run `pod install` to install your project's dependencies. 

## Building

### From the command line
Simply run `make`. 

### In Xcode

We do not provide or maintain an already-generated `.xcodeproj` in our repository. Instead, you must generate it locally.

**To generate the `.xcodeproj` file**:
1. Install the Ruby gem `xcodeproj` with `gem install xcodeproj` (you may need to `sudo`)
2. Run `make project`
3. You're ready to go! Open `MongoSwift.xcodeproj` and build and test as normal.

Why is this necessary? The project requires a customized "copy resources" build phase to include various test `.json` files. By default, this phase is not included when you run `swift package generate-xcodeproj`. So `make project` first generates the project, and then uses `xcodeproj` to manually add the files to the appropriate targets (see `add_json_files.rb`). 

## Running Tests
**NOTE**: `ClientTests`, `CollectionTests`, `CommandMonitoringTests`, `CrudTests`, and `DatabaseTests` all require a mongod instance to be running on the default host/port, `localhost:27017`. The remainder of the tests are for the BSON library, and should succeed regardless of whether a mongod is running.

Additionally, please note that each benchmark test runs for a minimum of 1 minute and therefore **the entire benchmark suite will take around 20-30 minutes to complete**.

You can run tests from Xcode as usual. If you prefer to test from the command line, keep reading.

### From the command line 
Tests can be run from the command line with `make test`. By default, this will run all the tests excluding the benchmarks.

To only run particular tests, use the `FILTER` argument, which is passed as the `filter` argument to `swift test`. This will run test cases with names matching a regular expression, formatted as follows: `<test-target>.<test-case>` or `<test-target>.<test-case>/<test>`.

For example, `make test FILTER=ClientTests` will run `MongoSwiftTests.ClientTests/*`. Or, `make test FILTER=testInsertOne` will only run `MongoSwiftTests.CollectionTests/testInsertOne`. 

To run all of the benchmarks, use `make benchmark` (equivalent to `FILTER=MongoSwiftBenchmarks`). To run a particular benchmark, use the `FILTER` argument to specify the name. To have the benchmark results all printed out at the end, run with `make benchmark | python Tests/MongoSwiftBenchmarks/benchmark.py`.

## Example Usage

### Connect to MongoDB and Create a Collection
```swift
import MongoSwift

let client = try MongoClient(connectionString: "mongodb://localhost:27017")
let db = try client.db("myDB")
let collection = try db.createCollection("myCollection")
```

Note: we have included the client `connectionString` for clarity, but if connecting to the default `"mongodb://localhost:27017"`it may be omitted: `let client = try MongoClient()`.

### Create and Insert a Document
```swift
let doc: Document = ["_id": 100, "a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3]
let result = try collection.insertOne(doc)
print(result?.insertedId ?? "") // prints `100`
```

### Find Documents
```swift
let query: Document = ["a": 1]
let documents = try collection.find(query)
for d in documents {
    print(d)
}
```

### Work With and Modify Documents
```swift
var doc: Document = ["a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3]

print(doc) // prints `{"a" : 1, "b" : 2, "c" : 3}`
print(doc["a"] ?? "") // prints `1`

// Set a new value
doc["d"] = 4
print(doc) // prints `{"a" : 1, "b" : 2, "c" : 3, "d" : 4}`
```
